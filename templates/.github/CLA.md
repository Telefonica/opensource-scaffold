# Why Require a CLA?
Agreeing to a CLA explicitly states that you are entitled to provide a contribution, that you cannot withdraw permission to use your contribution at a later date, and that <%= copyrightOwner %> has permission to use your contribution in our commercial products.

This removes any ambiguities or uncertainties caused by not having a CLA and allows users and customers to confidently adopt our projects. At the same time, the CLA ensures that all contributions to our open source projects are licensed under the project's respective open source license, such as Apache 2.0, MPL2 or MIT.

Requiring a CLA is a common and well-accepted practice in open source. Major open source projects require CLAs such as Apache Software Foundation projects, Facebook projects (such as React), Google projects (including Go), Python, Django, and more. Each of these projects remains licensed under permissive OSS licenses such as MIT, Apache, BSD, and more.

Signing the CLA
Open a pull request ("PR") to any of our projects to sign the CLA. A bot will comment on the PR asking you to sign the CLA if you haven't already.

Follow the steps given by the bot to sign the CLA. This will require you to log in with GitHub (we only request public information from your account) and to add a comment to the PR. We will store your Github user name in a branch in this repository. We will only use this information for CLA tracking; none of your information will be used for marketing purposes.

You only have to sign the CLA once. Once you've signed the CLA, future contributions to any <%= copyrightOwner %> project will not require you to sign again.

# Legal Terms and Agreement
In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, <%= copyrightOwner %>, Inc. ("<%= copyrightOwner %>") must have a Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the license terms below. This license does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to <%= copyrightOwner %>. Except for the license granted herein to <%= copyrightOwner %> and recipients of software distributed by <%= copyrightOwner %>, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

Definitions. "You" (or "Your") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with <%= copyrightOwner %>. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

"Contribution" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is or previously has been intentionally submitted by You to <%= copyrightOwner %> for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by <%= copyrightOwner %> (the "Work"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to <%= copyrightOwner %> or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, <%= copyrightOwner %> for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to <%= copyrightOwner %> and to recipients of software distributed by <%= copyrightOwner %> a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to <%= copyrightOwner %> and to recipients of software distributed by <%= copyrightOwner %> a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

You represent that you are legally entitled to grant the above license. If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that you create that includes your Contributions, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that you will have received permission from your current and future employers for all future Contributions, that your applicable employer has waived such rights for all of your current and future Contributions to <%= copyrightOwner %>, or that your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with <%= copyrightOwner %>.

You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. You represent that Your Contribution submissions include complete details of any third-party license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents and trademarks) of which you are personally aware and which are associated with any part of Your Contributions.

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON- INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

You agree to notify <%= copyrightOwner %> of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.
